# Sudoku_Solver

This project uses matlab to optimally solve Sudoku puzzles. You can find extensive explanation in the report pdf (in Greek).

## Brief project summary in English

- This project uses the binary integer programming approach and models the sudoku puzzle with such constrains so that it describes a boolean satisfiability problem. 
- From the images in the report pdf you can see things like the new boolean constrains or how/why I added 1 more dimension to the 2D sudoku problem to make it a 3D BIP problem. 
- A medium difficulty Sudoku puzzle can be solver in less than 4 msec.
